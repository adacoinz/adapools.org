One group-one pool is determined by choosing a non-saturated pool from such a group prior to the 96% saturation mark. Thus, any group shall have one pool represented in the listing at once. The one pool showing is then prioritized over other pools in that said group based on:

* the soonest pool registration date
* less than 96% saturation level
* and actual ranking position based on adapools ranking algorithm

Therefore, pool that is not showing from the group set up is based on

* younger pool registration date than the one pool showing
* higher saturation point larger than 96%
* lower ranking position than the one pool showing

Ranking of individual pools is determined by the "score formula" (subject to change) which can be accessed on https://adapools.org/score page for reference and peer review. Feedback welcome.

Groups are now predominantely based on the marketing/official grouping efforts of known associations (subject to change). Operators can create a claim to correct any errors/inaccuracies, provided substantial evidence is put forth to make a sound case. These groups are available on https://adapools.org/groups page for peer review. Feedback welcome.

Further, pool operators can make a claim against 'fake' pools that will be automatically removed from the listings once such a case is confirmed. This includes ticker disputes and other blatant attempts to scam/impersonate real world operators designed to deceive delegators.
